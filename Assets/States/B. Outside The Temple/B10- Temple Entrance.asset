  storyText: 'You are exhausted and scared to death, yet you cannot help but gasp
    at the view of the gigantic and forgotten temple.


    You step toward the entrance,
    stepping over the bits and pieces of rocks left by the explosion of the front
    entrance. You can strangely taste the smell of almond and metal as you get closer
    of the opening hole.


    There is no doubt anymore, that''s where you''ll find
    Salazar.


    1. Enter the temple.'
