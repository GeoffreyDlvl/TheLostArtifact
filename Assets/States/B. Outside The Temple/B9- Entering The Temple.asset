    Luckily enough,
    you did. You rummage through your backpack and finally hands the small cubic
    object to Dominguez. He inserts it into a small gap into the stone and pushes
    forcefully until you hear a loud *click*.


    The heavy doors of the temple
    suddenly crack open, just enough so Dominguez and yourself can slip your fingers
    into the opening and pull them open.


    The smell is heavy inside the dark
    temple. You look at Dominguez and Dominguez look at you. You take out your flashlight,
    prepared for whatever might be waiting for you inside.


    1.Enter the temple.'
