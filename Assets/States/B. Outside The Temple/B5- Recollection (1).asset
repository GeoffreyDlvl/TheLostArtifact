  storyText: 'Sounding out your memories of the past months, you try to recollect
    your first meeting with the ruthless mercenary known under the name of Salazar
    Escuela.


    You were investigating the Lost Artifact, accompanied with Dominguez,
    when Salazar went to meet you on a popular market. He threatened to kill you
    both right there in front of everyone, claiming that he owned half the police,
    unless you stop your foolish quest. You didn''t believe him back then, you didn''t
    know how dangerous Salazar was. But you were scared nonetheless and you told
    him you would leave Mexico. But as you were studying the Lost Artifact, you became
    obsessed with the old relic and decided that you would risk anything to find
    it - even your own life.


    1. Continue...'
