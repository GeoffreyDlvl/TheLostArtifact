  storyText: 'You walk around the temple. Dominguez and you can''t help but share
    how amazing the architecture is. The temple has been preserved from men for centuries
    and remain in excellent condition. Complex engravings run all over the walls.
    Dominguez would love to study them, but with Salazar''s men around, you need
    to hurry.


    There doesn''t seem to have any opening into the temple and soon
    enough, you''re back at the main door.


    What should you do now?

    1.
    Ask Dominguez for a clue.'
