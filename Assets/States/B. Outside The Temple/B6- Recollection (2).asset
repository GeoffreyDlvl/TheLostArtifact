  storyText: 'You wonder how this could have something to do with opening that door.
    Thinking about the reason you were out on this market that day, you remembered
    that you met an eccentric old man who claimed to possess invaluable artifacts
    that were holding the secrets to the Lost Artifact. He sold you one of these
    "invaluable" artifacts for a few pesos, which made you think that he was just
    a scam.

    The object he sold you was of a cubic shape with complex engravings
    on one side. Dominguez spent nights studying it but he never managed to get anything
    useful out of it.


    1. "That cube?"'
