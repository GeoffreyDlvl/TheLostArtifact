  storyText: 'Pushing away vines falling from the trees, you can''t make another
    step forward. You are frozen with wander. Before you sits a gigantic and forgotten
    temple. Speechless, you approach the main door. Dominguez is surprisingly silent
    too.


    The main door is shut down. This would have been too easy.


    What
    should you do now?

    1. Go around the temple, maybe there''s another entrance?

    2.
    Ask Dominguez for a clue.'
