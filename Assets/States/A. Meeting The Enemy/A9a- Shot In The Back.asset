  storyText: 'You suddenly start to run, hoping to get into the thickness of the
    jungle before the armed man get you into his line of fire. But his rifle was
    already pointing at you and a second after you started running, you hear the
    loud noise of a gun fired. You feel a sharp pain in your back when the bullets
    hit you.


    You fall on the ground and manage to turn around, only to see
    the barrel of the rifle aiming at your face. You never even had the time to hear
    the second shot.


    1. Continue...'
