  storyText: 'You''re kneeling, your hands behind your head. Salazar looks at your
    face and screams with surprise.


    "You?! The reporter?"


    He bursts into
    laughter. A joyless laugh that will haunt you forever, supposing that you survive
    this misfortune.


    "Tell me, why risk you life for an old piece of metal?"


    What
    do you answer Salazar?

    1. "Why I risk my life doesn''t concern you!"

    2.
    "Well, for the same reasons as you. You''re no stranger to the fact that this
    piece of metal, as you call it, is worth millions."

    3. "This artifact belongs
    in a museum, not in your hands!"'
