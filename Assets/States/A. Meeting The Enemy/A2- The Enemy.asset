  storyText: 'You look through the lens of your binoculars. You can see what appears
    to be an armored Jeep and three men outside de vehicle. Salazar''s men. They
    are armed and wear bulletproof vests, as if whatever Mayan tribe they could stumble
    upon would shoot at them with guns. Two men are leaning over the car''s hood,
    looking at plans and discussing. The last man turns his back on you and looks
    at something through the large leaves of the jungle.


    What should you do
    now?

    1. Stay low and approach stealthily. '
