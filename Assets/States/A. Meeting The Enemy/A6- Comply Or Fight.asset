  storyText: 'Salazar looks at you with nothing but a smirk on his face. He makes
    big gestures and mutters some Spanish word to his three men.  He picks up Dominguez
    who screams with fear and storms into the jungle, followed by two of his men
    and Dominguez. You noticed from the corner of your eyes one of the men picked
    up a package from the vehicle.


    You''re now alone with the last of Salazar''s
    men. He grabs you, raises you forcefully on your feet and pushes you into the
    deep and dark jungle. He''s pointing his rifle at you.


    What should you
    do now?

    1. Comply and move forward.

    2. Turn around and fight the man.

    3.
    Try to run away.'
