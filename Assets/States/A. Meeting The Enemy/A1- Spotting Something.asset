  storyText: "As you're stepping out of the thick jungle into a clearing, your eyes
    focused on the map, you feel a robust hand grasping your shoulder. \r\nDominguez
    brings his index over his mouth to gesture a shush. You quickly folds the map
    to the Lost Artifact into the rear pocket of your jeans and crouch behind a bush.\r\nYou
    listen carefully and hear it too: the low humming of a car and the sound of doors
    shut down. Far into the open space in front of you, you can make out gray shapes.\r\nYou
    look at Dominguez, worried, and you read fear in his eyes.\r\n\r\nWhat should
    you do now?\r\n1. Take the binoculars out of your backpack and observe the source
    of the noises.\r\n2. Stay low and approach stealthily. "
