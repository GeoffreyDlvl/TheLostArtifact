    group clear to Dominguez. You move forward through the jungle, making your best
    to bypass the clearing and stay into the shadows of the high trees. Dominguez
    reluctantly follows you.


    You soon get close enough to hear men talking
    in Spanish. Dominguez, your friend and guide, whispers in your ear than they
    plan to "get in"  as soon as "the boss" gives the green light.


    What should
    you do now?

    1. You don''t need the green light, just push forward now.

    Hide in the bushes and keep listening to them.'
