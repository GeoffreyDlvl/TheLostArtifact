    least 10 minutes now. Suddenly, he screams at you to stop. You feel a painful
    kick behind your knee that throws you to the ground. You turn around and look
    at Salazar''s man. You can read it in his eyes. This is it. This is the end.

    suddenly, there''s an explosion far into the deepest of the jungle that makes
    the earth shake. For one moment, your executioner looks away.
