  storyText: 'You throw your fist with all your strength into the jaw of the man.
    Teeth and blood fly around as he screams with pain. He let go of his rifle and
    you see an opening to grab his gun.


    You aim at the man who kneels and starts
    crying, begging for his life.


    What''s your decision?

    1. You are not
    a killer. You knock him out with the cross of the gun.

    2. A moment before,
    he wouldn''t have hesitated to kill you. Why should you? Execute him.'
