  storyText: 'You see Salazar and Dominguez in a huge and heavily decorated room.
    A large beam of light illuminated the tomb of the last Mayan king in the center
    of the room.

    

    Dominguez is squatting near the tomb, seemingly trying
    to decipher old engravings. Both are covered with blood.

    

    You approach
    the men, clueless of what to do next.

    

    What should you do now?

    1.
    Shout at Salazar.

    2. Silently approach them.'
