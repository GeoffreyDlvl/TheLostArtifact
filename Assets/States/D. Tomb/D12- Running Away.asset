  storyText: 'You rush to the exit of the tomb, shortly followed by Dominguez. Behind
    you, rocks are falling from the ceiling and walls are collapsing in a deafening
    ruckus.


    You run into the trapped corridor but your path is blocked by
    the unfolded spears. Through the deadly pieces of metal, you can see the exit.
    So close, yet so far.


    You start to crawl, dragging your sore body under
    the spears, past Salazar''s men mutilated bodies hanging above you, pulling yourself
    painfully through the blood and the dirt and the rubble.

    The walls are
    shaking even louder and the exit seems so close now.

    Eventually, you are
    able to stand up and starts to run towards the light.


    That''s when you
    hear Dominguez let out a cry of pain.


    Standing in the entrance, you need
    to make one last decision.

    1. Risk everything to pull Dominguez out.

    2.
    Exit the temple and leave Dominguez behind.'
