  storyText: 'As Dominguez is running to the exit, you go the opposite direction
    and rush to where Salazar was crushed in a desperate attempt to recover the Lost
    Artifact. You spent months looking for this ancient and mysterious Mayan relic
    and you weren''t ready to give up just now.



    You lift rocks out of the
    way, hurting your hands, all your muscles are sore and the whole world seems
    to collapse around you.



    Finally, you see it. It''s beautiful. It''s unique.
    You just need to reach for it and it will be yours. But as you extend your hand
    to grab the Lost Artifact, a massive piece of wall falls upon you, crushing you
    bones into a million pieces.



    Did you really expect to survive this chaos?



    1.
