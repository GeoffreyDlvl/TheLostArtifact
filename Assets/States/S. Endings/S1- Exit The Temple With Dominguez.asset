  m_Name: S1- Exit The Temple With Dominguez
  m_EditorClassIdentifier: 
  storyText: 'You run back to Dominguez. One of his legs is stuck under the spears.
    A piece of the deadly trap gave way under the weight of the debris and pierced
    through his calf until you could pull himself out.

    There''s not time to
    think as the whole temple is collapsing on itself. All you can do is try to pull
    your friend.

    With the little strength you have left, you pull as hard as
    you can until you hear Dominguez scream louder with pain when the piece of metal
    rips his muscle apart and free him.

    You drag Dominguez out of the temple,
    leaving a trail of blood behind you.

    

    You reach the exit with Dominguez.
    You turn around to see the temple disappear into the ground, leaving nothing
    but a wide chasm in the middle of the jungle.

    

    You hold your crying
    friend against you as you reach for your radio in your backpack.


    1. Continue...'
