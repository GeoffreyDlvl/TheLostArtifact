  storyText: 'You move further into the corridor. As you''re carelessly walking toward
    the grate, eager to lay your hands on the Lost Artifact, you feel a rock stone
    sink deeper into the floor under your foot. You can hear the click of a mechanism
    and Dominguez'' scream. You turn to look at him. The next thing you know, dozens
    of spears are piercing through your body. You wish a spear had pierced a vital
    organ, or your brain, but none of them did. You stand there, in the middle of
    this corridor, looking like a macabre bloody puppet. All you can do is scream
    with pain until you lose so much blood you can be freed from the pain. You have
    been warned and should''ve listened...


    1. Continue...'
