  storyText: 'You can''t breath as you''re walking up the corridor, careful not to
    step on any of these peculiar elevated stones. You heart is pumping hard in your
    chest and all you senses are on alert. You eventually reach the grate. You look
    back at Dominguez who takes the same path as you.


    You are now in front
    of a metal grate. You can see light on the other side. There''s a lever sticking
    out of the wall on your right.


    What should you do now?

    1. Peek through
    the gate.

    2. Pull the lever.'
