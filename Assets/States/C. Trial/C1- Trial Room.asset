  storyText: 'You step into a plain rectangular corridor. You both stop and take
    a moment to study the room. The ray of your flashlight dances on the stone walls.
    You can see hundreds of small circular openings along the opposite walls of the
    corridor but you can''t understand their purpose. It smells like iron.


    At
    the end of the corridor, you can see a grate. If you''re lucky enough, the artifact
    will be in the next room.


    What should you do now?

    1. Walk to the gate.

    2.
    Investigate the room more thoroughly.'
