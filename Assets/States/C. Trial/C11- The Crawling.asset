  storyText: 'You crawl under the spears and hanging bodies. Before you reach the
    end of the corridor, you are soaked with the warm blood that was spreading on
    the floor. You feel nauseated and want to puke, but you reject the discomfort
    with all your will. You need to stay focus. Salazar must be close.


    At the
    end of the corridor, there''s a squared opening with the shape of a door. On
    the other side, a well lit room and two men.


    What should you do now?

    1.
    Enter the room.'
