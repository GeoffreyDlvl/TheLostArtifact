  storyText: 'You arrive into a narrow corridor that smells of blood. Armed with
    nothing but your flashlight, you aim in front of you.


    You are struck with
    a vision of horror. Two bloody figures are grotesquely impaled on iron spears
    sticking out of the walls, blocking the way. The deadly weapons pierced right
    through the bulletproof vests, clothes and skin, crushing the bones and distorting
    the bodies in ridicule postures.


    Despite the horror, you are relieved that
    none of the two dead men is Dominguez. However, none of them is Salazar either.


    What
    should you do now?

    1. Crouch and crawl under the deadly trap.'
